# MNIST 
A 1,6 Millions parameters model trained on the MNIST dataset.
I coded this during my vacation, I didn't have my PC, so this model was trained on a Dell Inspiron 13 5000, with an i5 7200U 😭✌️. 
## How to test it?
**First, clone the repo : **  
```git clone https://github.com/abgache/mnist.git```
**Second, go download the [MNIST dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset), and unzip it in the data folder.**
**Then download the requirements :**  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
**Finnally, run the main script :**  
```python main.py```
